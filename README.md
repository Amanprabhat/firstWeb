Hi,
My name is Aman Prabhat and I have restarted my programming journey again after 4 years.

I have started learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript from The Odin Project and now I am working on a project to create a simple website using HTML and CSS. I am currently working as a chatbot developer in Leena AI and using no code tool to create chatbots.

I have mainly used the "Flex" properties of CSS
